# Bootstrap 4 + Jekyll

To use: when you have the dependancies as per
[the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) you should run
`bundle install`.

HTML files are based on Minima - if you need to configure
the post or page layouts, copy [those files](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts) in as needed.

Bootstrap variables can be overriden in `_sass/custom.scss` - refer
to the [full list of available values](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss).

Note that GitHub Pages doesn't run gems that aren't on their predefined list, so it won't work with their autocompile, you'll need to push up and serve the compiled files.

# Minima

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
